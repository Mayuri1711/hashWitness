# HashWitness

**Tagline:** "Every change witnessed, every day sealed on the blockchain."

HashWitness is a serverless audit pipeline built on AWS that allows you to **cryptographically prove that your files existed at a specific point in time** — without relying on any central authority.

It uses AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, OpenTimestamps, Merkle Trees, and Amazon S3 to ensure file integrity, tamper-proof logging, and verifiable timestamping.

## Use Case

Organizations often need to prove the **existence and integrity of files** (e.g., legal documents, logs, images) for compliance, audit trails, or legal evidence.

**HashWitness creates cryptographic timestamp proofs** and publishes them using decentralized systems (OpenTimestamps + Bitcoin network) — making the integrity independently verifiable even years later.

---

## Requirements

- AWS account with S3, Lambda, and DynamoDB access
- Node.js v18 or higher (for Lambda)
- IAM Roles with required permissions (see below)
- One S3 bucket (e.g., `hash-audit-bucket`)
- One DynamoDB table (e.g., `S3ObjectHashes`)
- [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/) for decentralized timestamping

---

## How It Works

1. Upload a file to S3
2. A Lambda hashes it and logs the info to DynamoDB
3. Every 24 hours, another Lambda builds a Merkle Tree of the hashes
4. Merkle Root is submitted to OpenTimestamps
5. The `.ots` proof file is saved to S3
6. After 24 hours, the proof is verified and confirmed anchored to Bitcoin

---

## Automation

* For full automation, use **AWS Step Functions** to orchestrate:

  * After `BuildMerkleTree`, run `SubmitToOTS`
  * After 24 hours, run `VerifyOTS`

You can also use **EventBridge rules** for scheduling and sequencing.

---

## Roadmap

* Add API Gateway for on-demand proof search
* UI dashboard for file status and audit trail
* SNS alerts on tampering
* Save `.ots` backups to Arweave/IPFS

## Why This Matters

HashWitness helps ensure **data integrity**, **proof of existence**, and **verifiability** without trusting a central party.
It anchors file evidence to **Bitcoin** via OpenTimestamps, making it decentralized and tamper-evident.
